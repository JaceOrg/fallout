# Inclusion patterns for git secrets
#
# This is under version control: DO NOT PUT LITERAL SECRETS IN HERE;
# patterns only.  Please test the patterns, and make sure that running:
#
#   git secrets --scan
#
# ...runs _quickly_ (it should be < 1 second).  If you define a pattern that is
# too hungry, the above command will take minutes.  An easy mistake is to use
# literal spaces instead of \s.
#
# See https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets#defining-prohibited-patterns for
